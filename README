NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::WSDL - WSDL to Perl classes when building your dist

VERSION
    version 0.102600

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin will create classes in your distribution for
    interacting with a web service based on that service's published WSDL
    file. It uses SOAP::WSDL and can optionally add both a class prefix and
    a typemap.

ATTRIBUTES
  uri
    URI (sometimes spelled URL) pointing to the WSDL that will be used to
    generate Perl classes.

  prefix
    String used to prefix generated classes. Default is "My".

  typemap
    A list of SOAP types and the classes that should be mapped to them.
    Provided because some WSDL files don't always define every type,
    especially fault responses. Listed as a series of "=>" delimited pairs.

    Example:

        typemap = Fault/detail/FooException => MyTypes::FooException
        typemap = Fault/detail/BarException => MyTypes::BarException

  generate_server
    Boolean value on whether to generate CGI server code or just interface
    code. Defaults to false.

METHODS
  before_build
    Instructs SOAP::WSDL to generate Perl classes for the provided WSDL and
    gathers them into the "lib" directory of your distribution.

INSTALLATION
