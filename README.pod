=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::WSDL - WSDL to Perl classes when building your dist

=head1 VERSION

version 0.203

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Dist::Zilla|Dist::Zilla> plugin will create classes in your
distribution for interacting with a web service based on that service's
published WSDL file.  It uses L<SOAP::WSDL|SOAP::WSDL> and can optionally add
both a class prefix and a typemap.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 uri

URI (sometimes spelled URL) pointing to the WSDL that will be used to generate
Perl classes.

=head2 prefix

String used to prefix generated class names.  Default is "My", which will result
in classes under:

=over

=item C<MyAttributes::>

=item C<MyElements::>

=item C<MyInterfaces::>

=item C<MyServer::>

=item C<MyTypes::>

=item C<MyTypemaps::>

=back

=head2 typemap

A list of SOAP types and the classes that should be mapped to them. Provided
because some WSDL files don't always define every type, especially fault
responses.  Listed as a series of C<< => >> delimited pairs.

Example:

    typemap = Fault/detail/FooException => MyTypes::FooException
    typemap = Fault/detail/BarException => MyTypes::BarException

=head2 generate_server

Boolean value on whether to generate CGI server code or just interface code.
Defaults to false.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 before_build

Instructs L<SOAP::WSDL|SOAP::WSDL> to generate Perl classes for the provided
WSDL and gathers them into the C<lib> directory of your distribution.
